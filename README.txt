First of all, I really thank you for giving me the opportunity to take this awesome task, I have learnt a lot of python GUIs, I have never developed a GUI using python before, and I learnt all these stuff in a really short period of time, I am really faster learner and hard worker that I would be happy if you give me chance to work with you. I am sure your learning curve is very good and will add a lot to me, sorry for submitting it just before the deadline, I was outside Egypt and I didn’t have my laptop. The GUI is simple as you mentioned, I tried covering all wrong cases I hope I didn’t miss anything, I also made the test cases using pytest-qt but for some reason it doesn’t collect test cases, I tried many solutions all failed, I am familiar with pytest I used it before in testing social media application (twitter clone) backend and it worked fine with me, you will find the pytest for twitter clone in my github account. Finally I hope my work is acceptable for you, I am ready to work and do my best with you in any projects. Let me know if there are any mistakes or flaws in my program, thanks in advance.
